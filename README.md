# Social Media App

Project from two university courses merged into one. Client Web Technologies and Server Web Technologies.
Developed throughout may of 2023, during the second year of my studies, third semester.

Project is a web appliation designed to be a social media and a reddit/facebook mockup.
It consists of users, groups, posts, comments, reports. Groups have its own moderators that are assigned during the creation of the group. Admins go through reports which can be on posts, comments and users and deside if they want to delete the post/comment and suspend the user who cannot log in after that.
